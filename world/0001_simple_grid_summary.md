# Simple Grid World (0001) - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a minimal JAX-compatible grid world at `world/simple_grid_0001/` with the following features:

### Core Design
- **Pure functional interface** - Immutable state for JAX compatibility
- **Minimal dependencies** - Only JAX/JAX NumPy required
- **No awareness of neural networks** - World only knows its own mechanics
- **Optimized for performance** - JIT-compilable operations

### World Mechanics
- **Grid**: Configurable size (default 100x100), toroidal wrapping
- **Agent**: Single agent starting at center
- **Rewards**: Clustered distribution for biological realism
- **Observation**: Single gradient value (0-1) indicating proximity to nearest reward
- **Actions**: 4 discrete actions (up, right, down, left)

### Key Files
- `types.py` - Clean type definitions (WorldState, Observation, etc.)
- `world.py` - Core implementation with JAX optimizations
- `example.py` - Usage examples with random and gradient-following agents
- `test_world.py` - Basic functionality and performance tests

### Performance
- Achieved 4.2x speedup with JAX JIT compilation
- Vectorized distance calculations
- Masked operations to avoid dynamic indexing issues

### Interface Example
```python
from world.simple_grid_0001 import SimpleGridWorld, WorldConfig

config = WorldConfig(grid_size=100, n_rewards=300)
world = SimpleGridWorld(config)

state, obs = world.reset(jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
result = world.step(state, action=1)
```

This implementation provides a clean foundation for future grid worlds while maintaining simplicity and performance.
